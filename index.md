> ## Digital transformation is revolutionising the Australian economy.

The Digital Business Council exists to develop, deploy and facilitate the adoption of digital standards in Australia. Digitisation will keep you in the game … and it may even let you change the rules.
The Council’s initial focus is on electronic invoicing – or eInvoicing. This is transforming the way businesses operate by saving them time and money. Switching to eInvoicing will help you to profitable growth.

According to research, eInvoicing can be up to 80% more efficient than traditional paper-based invoicing.
Paper based invoicing is costly, prone to error and requires manual processing by both the sender and recipient.
Studies have found that fixing an invoicing error can cost up to $50 each time. eInvoicing can reduce error rates dramatically.
Increasingly, businesses – *large and especially small* – are using accounting software to help manage their businesses. They know it saves time and money.

eInvoicing standardises and digitises invoice information exchange for all types and sizes of businesses. The invoice becomes an exchange of data and not an exchange of paper.

It means that any business can create and process invoices consistently, securely and reliably. It will help you manage your cash flow. It will reduce the time you spend entering data into your system. And it will start giving you the control over your business that you always wanted.

> *"eInvoicing is a transformational step in Australia’s digital business movement to a streamlined, integrated and productive economy, 
> and is an exciting step forward especially for the small business community."*

eInvoicing in Australia is based on international standards that are open, royalty free. It does not depend on any particular software so it shouldn’t matter what software you use.
