## Digital transformation is revolutionising the Australian economy.

The Digital Business Council exists to develop, deploy and facilitate the adoption of digital standards in Australia. Digitisation will keep you in the game… and it may even let you change the rules.

The Council’s initial focus is on electronic invoicing – or eInvoicing. This is transforming the way businesses operate by saving them time and money. Switching to eInvoicing will help you to profitable growth.

> *"eInvoicing is a transformational step in Australia’s digital business movement to a streamlined, integrated and productive economy, 
> and is an exciting step forward especially for the small business community."*

> **Peter Strong**, CEO Council of Small Business Australia and Chair Digital Business Council

eInvoicing in Australia is based on international standards that are open, royalty free. It does not depend on any particular software so it shouldn’t matter what software you use.
