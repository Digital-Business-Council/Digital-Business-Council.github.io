# Accessibility Policy

We are committed to providing websites that are accessible to everyone in the community. This is a requirement under the [Disability Discrimination Act 1992](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A04426).

## Web standards

We aim to meet the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/). Some users find PDF files inaccessible so we've provided alternative formats where possible. However, we are unable to make some PDF files fully accessible at this time.

We are continuing to explore ways of improving the accessibility of our content.

## Accessibility issues

We want our website to meet the highest accessibility level possible.

If you experience any accessibility or usability issues with our website, [contact us](mailto:contact@digitalbusinesscouncil.com.au).
