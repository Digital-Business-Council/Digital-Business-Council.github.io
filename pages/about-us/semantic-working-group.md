# The Semantic Working Group

The Semantic Working Group is a representative group of software and services industry expertise to establish a dialogue of generic requirements for implementation of the eInvoicing Framework. In particular it advises Council on: 
- the content of a Semantic dictionary of terms and concepts;
- the content used and the minimal content required for an eInvoice;
- the rules validating the content of an eInvoice;
- guidelines for the use of identifiers and code lists; and
- the content of adoption or adaption of existing national or international standards that support the Semantic model.
