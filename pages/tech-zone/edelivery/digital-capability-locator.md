# The Digital Capability Locator (DCL) specification

The Digital Capability Locator and Digital Capability Publisher enable an Access Point to determine the destination of a message in a dynamic environment. 

The Digital Capability Locator provides an Access Point with the answer to the following question:

*"where can I find information about the e-business capabilities of business X ?"*

The Digital Capability Locator is a mapping of participant identifiers to the digital address of the participantâ€™s Digital Capability Publisher. 

The Digital Capability Locator's lookup service is based on the OASIS Business Document Metadata Service Location Committee Specification Version 01, which provides a standardised approach to retrieval of a participant's digital capability address. The specification has been based on the successful implementation within the European Union's PEPPOL and eSENS initiatives.

The following specification documents provide further detail on the following topics: 

- The high-level business requirements;
- The quality of service requirements;
- The logical solution architecture;
- The API Definitions and associated implementation guide;
- Test assertions to support Service Providers to develop test cases to achieve accreditation.

## Known Implementations

Since there is usually only one DCL for a given national economy, the DCL service is normally implemented by a statutory authority - usually the issuer and registrar of the relevant business identifier.  In the Australian case, the identifer is the ABN and the DCL operator is expected to tbe the ATO.

Known implementations (open source or otherwise) are listed here.  Please modify this page and make a pull request to add your own.
