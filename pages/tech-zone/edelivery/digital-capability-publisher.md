# The Digital Capability Publisher (DCP)

The Digital Capability Locator and Digital Capability Publisher enable an Access Point to determine the destination of a message in a dynamic environment. The Digital Capability Publisher provides an Access Point with the answer to the following question:

*"What are the digital capabilities of business XYZ, what techncal features are supported and who do I contact if I have issues?"*

The DCP maintains a list of businesses IT services, with a list of services for each business. Each service lists supported business processes, document format identifiers and transport protocols.

The Council's Digital Capability Publisher specification is based on the [OASIS Service Metadata Publishing (SMP) Version 1.0 Committee Specification 03](http://docs.oasis-open.org/bdxr/bdx-smp/v1.0/bdx-smp-v1.0.html).
