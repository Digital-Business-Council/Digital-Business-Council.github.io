# The Access Point specification

An Access Point connects a business (and its natural systems) with the open and secure business-to-business (B2B) ecosystem. Access Points may provide a range of services (connectivity, message translation, data validation etc) to enable businesses to trade with buyers and suppliers in a consistent and seamless manner.  

However, the minimum standards for technical interoperability are defined in the specifications below.
