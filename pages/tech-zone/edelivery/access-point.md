# The Access Point specification

An Access Point connects a business (and its natural systems) with the open and secure business-to-business (B2B) ecosystem. Access Points may provide a range of services (connectivity, message translation, data validation etc) to enable businesses to trade with buyers and suppliers in a consistent and seamless manner.  

The Council's Access Point specification is based on the [OASIS AS4 Profile of ebMS 3.0 Version 1.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/ebxml-msg/ebms/v3.0/profiles/AS4-profile/v1.0/AS4-profile-v1.0.html).
