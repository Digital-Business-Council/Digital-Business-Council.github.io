# Benefits for Service Providers

Einvoicing results in more effective and higher quality data exchanges between various (existing and new) solutions and services.

A simplified and coherent set of standards reduces the technological burden for solution and software providers.

Standardising interoperability provides business with the freedom to change providers, meaning there is no lock-in. 

Using open standards and best practices maximises the ability to leverage off the shelf solutions for software and solution providers.

Innovation and investment in capabilities that support eInvoicing are fostered through sufficient certainty for software and solution providers.

A market would emerge for the creation of new business models, products and services.
