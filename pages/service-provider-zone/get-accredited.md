# Service Provider Accreditation

## What is accreditation? 

Accreditation is a process by which an Access Point Provider or a Digital Capability Publisher Service Provider is recognised by the Digital Business Council (Council) as having met certain technical criteria. It should be noted that accreditation is mandatory for a Service Provider (Access Point or Digital Capability Publisher) if it intends to provide services under the Council’s Framework.

Accreditation is granted by the Council as a recognition that the Service Provider adheres to the policies, standards and guidelines set out in the Council’s Framework and the services it offers meet a general standard of quality. The sections below outline the advantages and steps in the Council’s accreditation process.

## How does a Service Provider become accredited?

You need to follow these steps to become accredited:

**Step 1:** Download all the testing resources, agreements and documents on this page;

**Step 2:** This step is optional. In order to enable you to send a signal to the market of your intention to accredit your product, this step will result in Provisional Accreditation. To do this:

> **2.1:** Familiarise yourself with the documentation downloaded in Step 1; 
>
> **2.2:** Download the statement of intent letter [here]({{site.url | absolute}}/assets/Letter_of_Intent_-_Provisional_Accreditation.docx);
>
> **2.3:** Sign the statement of intent letter and return it by [email](Mailto:contact@digitalbusinesscouncil.com.au). This means that you:
>
> + Believe that you will be able subsequently to sign the accreditation agreements; 
>
>   + Access Point Provider [Agreement]({{site.url | absolute}}/assets/Access_Point_Provider_Agreement_v1.0.pdf);

>
> **2.4:** Once we have received the letter of intent properly signed we will confirm your provisional accreditation and post your company’s name on the website as a provisionally accredited organisation;

**Step 3:** Test your product or service against the relevant test assertions (Schedule 3 of the Provider Agreement). You need to record your test results in the format specified by the Council;

**Step 4:** We will publish instructions on how you can upload your test results to the website shortly. We will send you a receipt of application; and

**Step 5:** Council will notify you of the outcome of your application within five (5) working days from the receipt of the application.


## Why should I become accredited?

As an accredited Service Provider you can offer services to your clients that work within the Council’s Interoperability [Framework](https://digital-business-council.github.io/interoperability-framework/). When you are accredited for eInvoicing your clients can take advantage of an open platform that will help:

+ Increase their trading partner networks through the ability to exchange invoices with a larger number of businesses;
+ Improve data quality through the reduction of retyping and the removal of the need to PDF invoices;
+ Reduce the costs associated with processing invoices in particular through fewer errors; and
+ Enable further open eCommerce services to be developed by Council.
