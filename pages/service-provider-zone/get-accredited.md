# Service Provider Accreditation

## What is accreditation? 

Accreditation is a process by which an Access Point Provider or a Digital Capability Publisher Service Provider is recognised by the Digital Business Council (Council) as having met certain technical criteria. It should be noted that accreditation is mandatory for a Service Provider (Access Point or Digital Capability Publisher) if it intends to provide services under the Council’s Framework.

Accreditation is granted by the Council as a recognition that the Service Provider adheres to the policies, standards and guidelines set out in the Council’s Framework and the services it offers meet a general standard of quality. The sections below outline the advantages and steps in the Council’s accreditation process.

## How does a Service Provider become accredited?

You need to follow these steps to become accredited:

**Step 1:** Download all the testing resources, agreements and documents on this page;

**Step 2:** This step is optional. In order to enable you to send a signal to the market of your intention to accredit your product, this step will result in Provisional Accreditation. To do this:

> **2.1:** Familiarise yourself with the documentation downloaded in Step 1; 
>
> **2.2:** Download the statement of intent letter [here]({{site.url | absolute}}/assets/Letter_of_Intent_-_Provisional_Accreditation.docx);
>
> **2.3:** Sign the statement of intent letter and return it by [email](Mailto:contact@digitalbusinesscouncil.com.au). This means that you:
>
> + Believe that you will be able subsequently to sign the accreditation agreements; 
>     + Access Point Provider Agreement
>     + Digital Capability Publisher Provider Agreement
> + Anticipate that you will meet test assertions;
> + Give consent to your name being listed on Council’s website; 
>
> **2.4:** Once we have received the letter of intent properly signed we will confirm your provisional accreditation and post your company’s name on the website as a provisionally accredited organisation;

**Step 3:** Test your product or service against the relevant test assertions (Schedule 3 of the Provider Agreement). You need to record your test results in the format specified by the Council;

**Step 4:** We will publish instructions on how you can upload your test results to the website shortly. We will send you a receipt of application; and

**Step 5:** Council will notify you of the outcome of your application within five (5) working days from the receipt of the application.


## Why should I become accredited?

As an accredited Service Provider you can offer services to your clients that work within the Council’s Interoperability Framework. When you are accredited for eInvoicing your clients can take advantage of an open platform that will help:

+ Increase their trading partner networks through the ability to exchange invoices with a larger number of businesses;
+ Improve data quality through the reduction of retyping and the removal of the need to PDF invoices;
+ Reduce the costs associated with processing invoices in particular through fewer errors; and
+ Enable further open eCommerce services to be developed by Council.
