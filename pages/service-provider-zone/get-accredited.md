# Attention: Service Providers

The accredited Service Provider
(Access Point Service Providers and Digital Capability Publisher Service Providers) agreements are now drafted in the form of deed polls declared to the Digital Business Council, which enables agreement to the Accreditation Logo Use Rules and requires only unilateral signing by Service Providers. The Governance Working Group recently considered legal advice in this regard and agreed that deed poll is the best available option; they are now seeking feedback on the draft documents prior to finally recommending them to Council. 

There is significant consistency between the two documents and we have also provided a third attachment with a short analysis of which clauses are different that may assist efficiency of processing. You will note that the test assertions are not included in the deed polls as these are currently under further review.

Due to the nature of a deed poll as a unilateral agreement, the declarations cannot be negotiated or altered as would a contractual agreement. As such, it is recommended that Service Providers consider the deed polls carefully and provide feedback to the Secretariat by close of business Friday **31 March 2017**. If you intend on providing feedback but will not be able to meet this deadline, please advise the Secretariat prior to the deadline in order to have your feedback considered.

# Service Provider Accreditation

## What is accreditation? 

Accreditation is a process by which an Access Point Provider or a Digital Capability Publisher Service Provider is recognised by the Digital Business Council (Council) as having met certain technical criteria. It should be noted that accreditation is mandatory for a Service Provider (Access Point or Digital Capability Publisher) if it intends to provide services under the Council’s Framework.

Accreditation is granted by the Council as a recognition that the Service Provider adheres to the policies, standards and guidelines set out in the Council’s Framework and the services it offers meet a general standard of quality. The sections below outline the advantages and steps in the Council’s accreditation process.

## How does a Service Provider become accredited?

You need to follow these steps to become accredited:

**Step 1:** Download all the testing resources, agreements and documents on this page;

**Step 2:** This step is optional. In order to enable you to send a signal to the market of your intention to accredit your product, this step will result in Provisional Accreditation. To do this:

**Step 4:** We will publish instructions on how you can upload your test results to the website shortly. We will send you a receipt of application; and

**Step 5:** Council will notify you of the outcome of your application within five (5) working days from the receipt of the application.


## Why should I become accredited?

As an accredited Service Provider you can offer services to your clients that work within the Council’s Interoperability [Framework](https://digital-business-council.github.io/interoperability-framework/). When you are accredited for eInvoicing your clients can take advantage of an open platform that will help:

+ Increase their trading partner networks through the ability to exchange invoices with a larger number of businesses;
+ Improve data quality through the reduction of retyping and the removal of the need to PDF invoices;
+ Reduce the costs associated with processing invoices in particular through fewer errors; and
+ Enable further open eCommerce services to be developed by Council.
