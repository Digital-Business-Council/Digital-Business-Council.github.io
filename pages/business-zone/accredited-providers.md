# Accredited Providers

The Digital Business Council is currently offering Provisional Accreditation to service providers in anticipation of full Accreditation.

Provisionally Accredited providers have submitted the ‘letter of intent’ declaring their resolve to become a Digital Business Council accredited service provider and offering services in line with the Council’s eInvoicing Interoperability [Framework](https://digital-business-council.github.io/interoperability-framework/).

As Provisionally Accredited Service Providers, these businesses are signalling their intention to commit resources to undertake the testing and implementation of their services to conform with the Framework.

Full Accreditation is granted after testing occurs and agreements are signed. Accreditation will enable an eCommerce service provider to market their products and services under the Interoperability Framework.
