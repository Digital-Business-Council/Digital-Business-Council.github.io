## eInvoicing

According to research, eInvoicing can be up to 80% more efficient than traditional paper-based invoicing.
Paper based invoicing is costly, prone to error and requires manual processing by both the sender and recipient.
Studies have found that fixing an invoicing error can cost up to $50 each time. eInvoicing can reduce error rates dramatically.
Increasingly, businesses – *large and especially small* – are using accounting software to help manage their businesses. They know it saves time and money.

eInvoicing standardises and digitises invoice information exchange for all types and sizes of businesses. The invoice becomes an exchange of data and not an exchange of paper.

It means that any business can create and process invoices consistently, securely and reliably. It will help you manage your cash flow. It will reduce the time you spend entering data into your system. And it will start giving you the control over your business that you always wanted.
