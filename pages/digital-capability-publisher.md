# The Digital Capability Publisher specification

The framework depends heavily on the ability to discover detailed service information for any given business identifier.  The DCP maintains a list of businesses, with a list of services for each business. Each service lists supported document formats and transport protocols and holds a digital certificate for message signing and encryption.
