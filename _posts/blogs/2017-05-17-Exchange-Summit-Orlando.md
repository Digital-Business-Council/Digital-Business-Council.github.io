On the 25th and 26th
of April Peter Strong, Chair of the Digital Business Council and CEO of Small Business Organisations of Australia (COSBOA) presented at the Exchange Summit in Orlando. The Exchange Summit: eInvoicing and Beyond presents opportunities at a global level to network and meet experts in the eInvoicing and Procure to Pay sector. It is important that the Council’s work builds on lessons learned from other countries experiences further inform the whole of economy approach in Australia for the benefit of all businesses. There was representation from several countries including those from Europe, North America, South America and Australia. Over the course of the two days experiences from within these countries were shared including several case studies and broader procure to pay lessons. The Australian contingent met with several overseas organisations that were keen to adopt the Council’s Interoperability Framework. Some also indicated interest in beginning Proof of Concepts (PoCs) with Australian businesses. It was exciting to speak with the US representatives who are examining the viability of the US adopting the Australian Framework. Important conversations were also held around the latest trends in digital transformation. The Digital Business Council was excited to be a part of such a significant event!
