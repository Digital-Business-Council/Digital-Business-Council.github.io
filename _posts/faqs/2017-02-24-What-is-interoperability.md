Interoperability is the ability of different information technology systems and software applications to communicate, exchange data, and use the information that has been exchanged.
In a practical sense, it means that businesses can connect once to the eInvoicing framework and exchange their invoices with any other business using the network â€“ even if the trading parties use different technologies to do so.
