Yes, accreditation is an essential governance tool used to enforce interoperability and to enable trust. It is in recognition that a service provider adheres to the Council’s requirements along with the policies, standards and guidelines articulated in the Framework. Accreditation has also been accepted by service providers as a desirable status and a precondition to being listed under the business discovery capability, i.e. an access point’s address can be automatically discovered via the digital capability locator and publisher components.
