The costs associated with eInvoicing are absorbed by the software systems used by businesses to run their businesses. The degree to which that cost would be passed on to a business is a matter for the software developer concerned. 
The terms of the accreditation agreement to the Framework and standards do not allow an Access Point to charge to exchange a message with another Access Point. Software developers will reach agreements with Access Points to transmit messages (unless they decide to be an Access Point themselves).
