title: "What if I don't get involved in eInvoicing?"
date: 2017-02-23
categories: [faq, einvoice-accreditation]
comments: eInvoicing is the first step to digitising the entire procure to pay lifecycle, which in turn overlaps with other lifecycles such as logistics/distribution, trade facilitation, financial services supply chain and digital reporting. eInvoicing establishes basic reusable building blocks that can be used when digitising these other lifecycles.  Companies involved in eInvoicing will be able to leverage their existing investments and experiences to expand their services to offer innovative solutions to the Australian business community.
