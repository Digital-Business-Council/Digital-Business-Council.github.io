The Council is assisting software and service providers in early adoption implementation. Early adoption takes the form of a pilot or a proof of concept and is directly supported by the Council in the form of marketing and adoption resources. Pilots are intended to promote eInvoicing for a particular market segment or scenario. Participation in a pilot requires the service provider to nominate a client or themselves to exchange eInvoices with a willing trading partner. Nominations can be sent to contact@digitalbusinesscouncil.com.au. A proof of concept, or other ofrm of testing, is also encouraged.
