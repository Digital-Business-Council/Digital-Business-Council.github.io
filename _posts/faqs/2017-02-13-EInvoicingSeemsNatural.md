eInvoicing is based on an open Interoperability Framework (Framework). It is the Framework that facilitates the open exchange of eInvoices. Eventually, other eCommerce transactions or exchanges of information will become enabled.

The Framework provides a set of “train tracks” with a common gauge that can support the transport of messages (“trains”) that adhere to a common standard.

An eInvoice is a collection of data that is standardised and can, therefore, be carried by the Framework and translated as necessary at points along the way.
