The Council was formed to lead and oversee the definition of a national framework of standards for exchanging data between software solutions with an initial focus on eInvoicing.
This industry group will promote the widespread adoption of the framework; monitor the extent to which solution providers are adopting the framework and businesses are adopting eInvoicing; identify barriers to adoption; and commission further work to agree recommendations for other business transactions.
