Digital Capability Publishers (DCPs) are providers of a service for Buyers and Suppliers to store details of their capabilities, and includes what scenarios they can process, the data formats they support and the delivery address for their eInvoices.DCPs are rich stores of B2B metadata that enable Access Points to not only determine the digital endpoint for eInvoicing messages but also other key metadata related to quality of service and fault resolution.Â  The Digital Business Council has provided guidance to support Accredited Service Providers to build their own DCP, configure open source solutions or to partner with another DCP Provider.
