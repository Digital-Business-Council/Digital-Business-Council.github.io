eInvoicing is a broadly used term that covers the exchange of invoice related documents between a supplier and a buyer in an integrated electronic format.
The Digital Business Councilâ€™s open approach standardises and digitises invoice information and the way that information is exchanged between a supplier and a buyer. Businesses can create and process invoices consistently, securely, reliably and predictably.
