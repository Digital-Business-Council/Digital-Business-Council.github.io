The short answer is “no”.If you are a business that sends or receives invoices, your software provider will have made arrangements and/or have modified their product to conform to the Digital Business Council Framework.
If you are a B2B or eCommerce service provider then there will be some investment required to modify your capability to map to the eInvoice semantic model. Feedback from service providers to date suggests that the cost and risk of doing this are low.
If you are a software developer, then you may decide either to build the capabilities of an eInvoicing Access Point into your software or to form a partnership with a specific access point.
