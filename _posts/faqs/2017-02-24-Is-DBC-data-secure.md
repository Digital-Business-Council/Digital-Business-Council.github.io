---The Council’s Framework is designed to ensure secure transport of data between Access Point Providers. Access Point Providers need to ensure the security in transmissions between themselves and their customers. Further security related guidance is provided in the Council’s threat model which can be provided to service providers. Service providers can use the threat model as a guideline when conducting their own threat and risk assessments on their implementations. The only infrastructure the Council provides is the central digital capability locator (DCL) infrastructure. The DCL only allows accredited service providers with the appropriate credentials to update the DCL.
