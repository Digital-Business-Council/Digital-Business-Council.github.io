eInvoicing is an industry led initiative that receives support from the Australian Government through the Australian Business Register. This support includes secretariat resources and subject matter expertise.
International studies and practical experiences also support the view that the take-up of eInvoicing has accelerated in countries where the government procurement agencies have adopted eInvoicing. Within the public sector there is ongoing work with the three levels of government to introduce policies, if any are needed, to encourage the use of digital technologies for eInvoicing. Any relevant policy changes for the public sector are expected to be published by the Government.
