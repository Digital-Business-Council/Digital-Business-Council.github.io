## Accreditation process update ##


The finalisation of the full accreditation process is taking
longer than anticipated. To optimise the experience for service providers and
their customers the right governance around the process needs to be in place.  

We are aiming to finalise the accreditation process on or
before 31 March 2017.

The accreditation process will be based on a deed poll by
you to an accreditation authority which initially is expected to be the ATO. Legal
considerations in establishing that authority are taking longer to resolve. One
necessary factor is that the accreditation authority needs to be “portable”. This
means that the registration of accreditation could be carried out by someone
other than the DBC or the ATO in future. This legal advice is key to the
finalisation of the process by 31 March 2017. 

Once the accreditation process is published you will be able
to accredit as an Access Point but not yet as a DCP. This is because the
current DCL is an alpha version where the publication process is manual. DCP
accreditation will have an automated publication process incorporated into the
beta version.

The
procurement process for the DCL has commenced. The target date for a first
production pilot version is 8 May 2017. This version can be used for DCPs to
test and accredit. We expect to develop a final production pilot for 3 July
2017. The final production pilot can be used for live transactions. These dates
depend upon the current procurement activities to select a systems integrator
to build the DCL and on the plan agreed with the systems integrator.

We will update this information if it changes.
